**Library**:
- Think of a library as a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks in your program. 
- It's like a toolbox with tools you can use when you need them.
- A library is like going to furniture store. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You donâ€™t feel like making your own table from scratch. furniture store allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control.
- You have control over your program, and you decide when to use the library's functions.
- Libraries are usually smaller in scope and don't dictate the overall structure of your program.
- You call the functions from a library when you want to use them.

**Framework**:
- A framework is like a blueprint or a pre-designed structure for building a specific type of application. It's like a house with rooms already set up, and you just need to decorate them.
- The framework controls the overall flow and structure of your application. You work within the framework's rules and guidelines.
- Frameworks are more extensive and often provide a complete application structure, including rules for how you organize your code.
- Your code is called by the framework when certain events or conditions occur.

In essence, a library gives you tools to use in your code, while a framework gives you a structure and rules to follow when building your application.


Example: 

Library: jQuery, React, NumPy, Pandas
Frameworks: Angular, Vue.js, Django, Flask, Laravels
