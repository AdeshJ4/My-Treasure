Adding Forms in React: 
----------------------

-> Just like in HTML, React uses forms to allow users to interact with the web page
-> By default When we submit an html form that form is posted to server so we ge full page reload.
-> to solve this problem we have to prevent this default behavior and let React control the form.
-> In real worls application quite often when submmiting the form we need to call the server to save the data .


Handling Forms: 

-> Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.
-> In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.
-> In React, form data is usually handled by the components.
-> When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.
-> You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange, onSubmit attribute
-> We can use the useState Hook to keep track of each inputs value and provide a "single source of truth" for the entire application







Code :

ex.1 : without table

const Form = () => {

  const submitForm = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('Submitted.');
  }
  return (
    <>
      <form onSubmit={submitForm}>
        <div className="mb-3">
          <label htmlFor="name" className="form-label">
            Name
          </label>
          <input id="name" type="text" className="form-control" />
        </div>

        <div className="mb-3">
          <label htmlFor="age" className="form-label">
            Age
          </label>
          <input id="age" type="number" className="form-control" />
        </div>

        <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
};
