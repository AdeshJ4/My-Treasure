React Custom Hooks:
-------------------

-> Hooks are reusable functions.
-> When you have component logic that needs to be used by multiple components, we can extract that logic to a custom Hook.
-> Custom Hooks start with "use". Example: useFetch.


Example: 
--------


-> Suppose we have Home Component inside that we are fetching the data.
-> The Fetch Logic may be needed in another component as well, so we extract that logic inside custom hook.
