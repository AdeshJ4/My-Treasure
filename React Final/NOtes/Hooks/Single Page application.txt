single-page applications:
-------------------------

1. **Traditional Websites vs. SPAs**:

-> 'Traditional websites' load a 'new HTML 'page from the 'server' every time you click a link or request a new 
URL. This process involves a full page refresh, which can be slower and less interactive.

-> In SPA, we initially load just one HTML page most of the time its a Home page. Then, SPA use JavaScript 
to handle user interactions. 
-> When you click on a link or a button to navigate to a different "page" like suppose from home page to 
contact page, 
then React uses a mechanism (such as AJAX requests) to fetch the data needed for the contact page.
-> This data may include information for a new table, additional text, images, or any other content specific 
to the contact page.
-> when we talk about fetching data, we typically refer to retrieving the necessary information needed to 
update the content of the page. This data can include various types of information such as text, images, 
tables, etc. then question aries that why page is not reloaded? answer is that :-
-> React uses a router (like React Router) to manage navigation within the application.
When a user clicks on a link or interacts with the app to navigate to a different "page" (view), the router 
'intercepts the request' and prevents the 'default browser navigation'.
This makes the user experience faster and smoother.

   - SPAs are often used for applications where user interaction is a priority, such as social media sites, 
   web-based email clients, project management tools, and online stores. They're excellent for creating 
   highly interactive and engaging web experiences.

   - SPAs introduce some challenges, like search engine optimization (SEO) difficulties (though these can be 
   mitigated with proper techniques), and initial load times can be longer since the whole application code 
   must be loaded upfront. Also, they may not work well on older web browsers.
