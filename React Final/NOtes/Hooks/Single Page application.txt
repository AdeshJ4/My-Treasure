Single Page Application (SPA)

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that dynamically updates the content of a single HTML page instead of loading new pages from the server. 
This makes the application faster, smoother, and more interactive by eliminating full-page reloads.



How Does an SPA Work?

ðŸ‘‰ When a user visits a React SPA, the browser loads a minimal HTML file (usually index.html) along with the necessary JavaScript, CSS, and assets.
ðŸ‘‰ The JavaScript bundle (React, components, and logic) is downloaded and executed.
ðŸ‘‰ The JavaScript framework/library (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) takes over and manages the app.
ðŸ‘‰ Traditional websites request a new page from the server when navigating. React manages routes on the client-side using React Router without full page refresh.
ðŸ‘‰ When the URL changes, React re-renders components dynamically without refreshing the page.
ðŸ‘‰ SPAs fetch data asynchronously using APIs (REST, GraphQL) via fetch or axios.
ðŸ‘‰ React uses a "Virtual DOM" to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed instead of reloading the entire page.
ðŸ‘‰ The UI updates dynamically without refreshing the page, making the experience faster.
ðŸ‘‰ Instead of reloading the whole page, only the changed components are updated.
ðŸ‘‰ React uses the Virtual DOM to efficiently compare updates and modify the real DOM only where necessary.
ðŸ‘‰ SPAs are not SEO-friendly by default since search engines rely on HTML content.
ðŸ‘‰ SPAs use state management tools like React useState, Redux, Zustand, React Query, etc. to handle data across components.






ðŸŸ¢ Real DOM â†’ Slow, updates the entire page
ðŸŸ¢ Virtual DOM â†’ Fast, updates only changed elements
ðŸŸ¢ React uses Virtual DOM â†’ Efficient UI rendering


1. What is the Real DOM?
The Real DOM is the actual HTML structure rendered in the browser.
It is slow because modifying the DOM (like updating an element) requires re-rendering the entire UI.

2. What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM.
React updates the VDOM first instead of modifying the Real DOM directly.
This makes updates faster and more efficient.

React JSX:
==========

ðŸ‘‰ JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
ðŸ‘‰ JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.
ðŸ‘‰ JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
ðŸ‘‰ You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.
ðŸ‘‰ With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }.
The expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression. JSX will execute the expression and return the result:
```
const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>;
```
ðŸ‘‰ JSX follows XML rules, and therefore HTML elements must be properly closed.

fragment:
=========
Alternatively, you can use a "fragment" to wrap multiple lines. This will prevent unnecessarily adding extra nodes to the DOM.
A fragment looks like an empty HTML tag: <></>.

React Conditional Rendering
===========================

In React, you can conditionally render components.
There are several ways to do this.
