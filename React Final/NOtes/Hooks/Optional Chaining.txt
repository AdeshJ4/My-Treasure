*** Optional Chaining ***
-----------------------

-> Optional chaining is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to safely access properties and methods of an object without worrying about whether those properties or the object itself exist. 
-> It helps prevent errors, like "Cannot read property 'something' of undefined," that can occur when you try to access properties on objects that might be null or undefined


ex> 

// An empty person object with missing optional location information
const person = {}

// The following will equate to undefined instead of an error
const currentAddress = person.location?.address
