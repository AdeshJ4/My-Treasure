step 1: run : expo init DoneWithIt
step 2: you will get this options: 

? Choose a template: » - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    ----- Managed workflow -----
>   blank               a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas
    blank (TypeScript)  same as blank but with TypeScript configuration
    tabs (TypeScript)   several example screens and tabs using react-navigation and TypeScript
    ----- Bare workflow -----
    minimal             bare and minimal, just the essentials to get you started  (Android and ios)


choose blank (Project without Android and ios folder) 
choose minimal (contain Android and ios folder)




for running the project: 
=======================
npx expo start





Nope, you're good — the command you used is **not outdated**.

```bash
expo init DoneWithIt
```

is still the **recommended way** to create a new Expo project in 2025.

### ✅ What `expo init` does:

* Creates a new React Native app using the **Expo managed workflow**
* Gives you a template option (like `blank`, `blank with TypeScript`, or `tabs`)
* Sets up everything needed to run the app with **Expo Go**

---

### Want to check your Expo CLI version?

Run this:

```bash
npx expo --version
```

If it's outdated, you can update it like this:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Or if you're using the new **Expo CLI 6+ (recommended)**, use:

```bash
npm install -g expo
```

Let me know if you’re planning to use custom native code or just sticking to the managed workflow — I can help you pick the right setup.
