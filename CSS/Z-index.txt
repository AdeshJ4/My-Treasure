The `z-index` in CSS controls the **stacking order** of elements along the z-axis (which is front-to-back).

### ðŸ“Œ Quick Summary:
- **Higher `z-index` = Closer to the user (on top)**
- **Only works on elements with `position: relative | absolute | fixed | sticky`**
- Default `z-index` is `auto`

### ðŸ”§ Example:

```css
.box1 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}

.box2 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2; /* This will appear on top of .box1 */
}
```

So, use `z-index` to control which elements appear in front when they overlap.
