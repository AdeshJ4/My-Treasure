3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state): 
=====================================================================

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus


1. 'link' is a pseudo-class-selector which is used to select and style unvisited links
2. 'visited' is a pseudo-class-selector which is used to select and style visited links
3. 'hover ' is pseudo-class-selector which is used to select and style element once you mouse over it.


ex: 
<a href="www.google.com">Google.com</a>
a:link{
    color: blue;
}
a:hover{
    color: red;
}


-> Pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes:

    <p>Para 1</p>
    <p class="onlyMe">Para 2</p>
    <p>Para 3</p>
    p.onlyMe:hover{
        color: powderblue;
    }


-> Simple Tooltip hover
    <div>
      <p>Para 1</p>
      <p class="para2">Para 2</p>
    </div>

    .para2{
        display: none;
        background-color: yellow;
        padding: 20px;
    }
    div:hover p.para2{
        display: block;
    }
