    justify-content: center;  /* horizontally center*/
    align-items: center;  /* vertically center*/



line-height: 
============
-> you can't give normal 'height' property to an flex-items, if you give then height of the item will increase but alignment of the 
content will move to flex-start.
-> to avoid this and to give height to an flex-item we give 'line-height'.

div.myDiv > div{
    width: 400px;
    text-align: center;    // horizontally center element
    line-height: 75px;     // vertically center the element
}


flex-grow property: 
===================
-> The flex-grow property specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.

<div class="flex-container">
  <div style="flex-grow: 1">1</div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 1">2</div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 8">3</div>
</div>



flex-shrink Property:
=====================
-> The flex-shrink property specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.

flex-shrink: 0; /* This item won't shrink and remain as it is like constants */
flex-shrink: 1; /* default value is 1. */
flex-shrink: 2; /* This item will shrink twice as much as other items*/

<div style="flex-shrink: 2;">1</div>



flex-basis Property:
===================
-> The flex-basis property specifies the initial length of a flex item.
<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div style='flex-basis: 200px'>2</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>



align-self property: 
===================
-> The align-self property specifies the alignment for the 'selected item' inside the flexible container.
-> The align-self property 'overrides' the default alignment set by the container's 'align-items' property.

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div style="align-self: center">2</div>
  <div>3</div>
</div>
