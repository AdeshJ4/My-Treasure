cascading is applying styles in order from top to bottom.

1. If you have applied different property values to the same property in different areas of your CSS, the last property value will be rendered.
ex: 

h2{
    font-size: 40px;
}
h2{
    color: green;
}
h2{
    color: red;
}

-> The last "color: red" property will be applied.







What is the Cascade?

-> The cascade is how the browser determines what styles to apply to a particular element.
