Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class): 
=============================================================

-> In nutshell CSS give more preference to id inline css then external css then id then class then universal selector

i] element Selector: 
-> The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
<p>Element Selector</p>
p{
    color: red
}

ii] id Selector: 
-> id selector uses the 'id attribute' of an HTML element to select a specific element
-> An id name cannot start with a number!
-> we use # to give style
-> The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element.
-> if id selector and class selector have the same css property and define on same element then css will give preference to id selector
-> inside id selector we write unique property of an element.
-> IDs are meant to be unique in an HTML document. If multiple elements have the same id, it violates the HTML specification.
Browsers still try to render the page, but it’s not valid HTML, and can lead to unpredictable behavior
⚠️ JavaScript Pitfall
document.getElementById('box') will return only the first matching element, not all.
This can cause bugs, especially when you're trying to manipulate the DOM and assume there's only one element.


ex:
<p id='para1'>ID Selector</p>
#para1{
    color: blue;
}

<h1 id="head1" class="head">Home Page</h1>  // render in blue
#head1{
    color: blue;
}
.head{
    color: red;
}


iii] class Selector: 
-> class selector uses the 'class attribute' of an HTML element to select multiple elements.
-> we use . to give styling
-> if you have a common properties to apply on multiple elements then use class selector.
-> HTML elements can have more than one class.
-> A class name cannot start with a number!
-> you apply class attribute to specific 'element name' like if you want to apply css only on all p tags then you can do that, even 
if you applied same class on h tag.

<p class="para">Paragraph</p>
.para{
    color: red;
}

<p class="para1 para2">Paragraph</p>  // render in blue
.para1{
    color: red;
}
.para2{
    color: blue;
}

// only p tags will get all properties of common class
<h1 class="common">Heading</h1>
<p class="common">Paragraph</p>  
<p class="common">Paragraph</p>  
p.common{
    color: red;
}



universal selector (*): 
-> universal selector selects all html elements.
-> it also called wildcard selector.
* {
  color: blue;
}


Grouping Selector: 
-> if multiple elements have the same style then we can group them together.
h1{
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}
p{
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}
you can group above two style in one: 
h1, p {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}
