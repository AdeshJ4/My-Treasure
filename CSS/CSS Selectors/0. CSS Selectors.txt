-> CSS selectors are used to "find" or select the HTML elements you want to style


We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4.   (select and style a part of an element)
5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
