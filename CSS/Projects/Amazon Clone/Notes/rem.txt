What is the rem unit?
-> rem stands for 'root em', which is a measurement unit that refers to the font-size of the root element(html) of a document.
-> It is a relative unit, which means all values that use it change when the root's font-size changes.

-> So, if you declare the root's font-size to be 16px (which is the default font size) like this:

html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

1rem = 16px
2rem = 32px
0.5rem = 8px
