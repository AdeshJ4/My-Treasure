The display Property:

-> The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.
-> Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. 
-> The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
-> The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.


Block-level Elements: 
-> A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a 'new line' and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right 
as far as it can).
Examples of block-level elements:
<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>


Inline Elements: 
-> An inline element DOES NOT start on a 'new line' and only takes up as much width as necessary.
-> you cannot set height and width property for inline element. for that you have to use 'display: inline-block' property.
-> an inline element with display: block; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.
Examples of inline elements:
<span>
<a>
<img>
