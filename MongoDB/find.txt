There are 2 methods to find and select data from a MongoDB collection, 

1. find()
2. findOne().


1. find()

-> find() method return all documents from collection if no query object is passed.
-> This method accepts a query object.
-> if query object is pass then selected documents will be returned who match the 
    query object.




2. findOne()

-> findOne() method return only first document.
-> This method also accepts query object
-> If left empty, it will return the first document it finds.




3. findOneAndDelete() and findOneAndReplace(): 

-> findOneAndDelete is focused on deleting a document, while findOneAndReplace is focused on replacing a document with a new one.
-> findOneAndDelete: Returns the deleted document or null if no document is found.
-> findOneAndReplace: By default, returns the original document before replacement.

// Delete a document where the 'username' is 'john_doe'
db.tb1.findOneAndDelete({name: 'john_doe'});

// Delete a document where the 'status' is 'inactive' and return only the 'username' field
db.tb1.findOneAndDelete({status: 'inactive'}, { projection: {name: 1, _id: 0}})

// Replace a document where the 'username' is 'john_doe' with a new document
db.tb1.findOneAndReplace({ username: 'john_doe' }, { username: 'jane_doe', age: 30 })

// Replace a document where the 'status' is 'active' and return only the 'username' field
db.tb1.findOneAndReplace({ status: 'active' }, { username: 'new_username', status: 'inactive' }, {projection: {userName: 1, _id: 0}})
