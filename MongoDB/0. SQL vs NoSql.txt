MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). MongoDB is designed to 
handle a variety of data types and is particularly well-suited for storing unstructured or semi-structured data. Here are the 
main data types that MongoDB supports:

1. **String:** This is the most commonly used data type to store textual data.

2. **Integer:** Used to store whole numbers.

3. **Double:** Used to store floating-point numbers.

4. **Boolean:** Stores either true or false.

5. **Arrays:** Allows you to store multiple values in a single field.

6. **Object:** Used for embedded documents or sub-documents within a document.

7. **Null:** Represents a null or non-existent value.

8. **Date:** Stores the current date or a specific date.

9. **Timestamp:** Typically used to store the creation time of a document.

10. **Binary Data:** Can store binary data, such as images or documents.

11. **ObjectId:** A special 12-byte identifier typically employed as the primary key for a document.

12. **Regular Expression:** Allows you to store regular expressions for pattern matching.

13. **Geospatial Data Types:** MongoDB supports geospatial data types like Point, LineString, and Polygon for geospatial queries.

14. **Min/Max Keys:** Used to compare a value against the lowest and highest BSON elements.

These data types can be combined to create complex documents within MongoDB. Documents are stored in collections, which are analogous to tables in relational databases. MongoDB's flexible schema allows you to store data without a predefined structure, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

It's worth noting that MongoDB doesn't enforce a rigid schema, so you can have variations in the structure of documents within the same collection. This flexibility is one of the key features of MongoDB and makes it well-suited for agile development and applications where the data structure may evolve over time.
