### **How Garbage Collection Works in V8 üöÄ**  

V8 (the JavaScript engine used in **Node.js and Chrome**) manages **memory allocation and garbage collection (GC)** automatically. It uses a **generational garbage collection** strategy to efficiently clean up unused memory.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Management in V8**  
V8 divides memory into different **heap** regions:  

| **Heap Region**      | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|------------|
| **New Space** (Young Generation) | Stores short-lived objects. |
| **Old Space** (Old Generation) | Stores long-lived objects. |
| **Large Object Space** | Stores large objects separately. |
| **Code Space** | Stores compiled JavaScript code. |
| **Map Space** | Stores metadata about objects. |

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Generational Garbage Collection in V8**
V8 uses **two main types** of garbage collection based on object lifetime:

#### ‚úÖ **Young Generation (Scavenge GC)**
- Contains **short-lived** objects.  
- Uses the **Scavenge algorithm** (copy-paste garbage collection).  
- Memory is split into **two semi-spaces**: **From Space** and **To Space**.  
- **Process:**
  1. Allocate new objects in **From Space**.
  2. When full, **live objects are copied to To Space**, and **dead objects are discarded**.
  3. Spaces are swapped.

üü¢ **Fast and efficient for short-lived objects**.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Old Generation (Mark-Sweep & Mark-Compact GC)**
- Contains **long-lived** objects that survive **multiple Young GC cycles**.
- Uses **Mark-Sweep** and **Mark-Compact algorithms**.
- **Process:**
  1. **Mark Phase**: Identifies reachable (used) objects.
  2. **Sweep Phase**: Frees memory of unreachable (unused) objects.
  3. **Compact Phase**: Defragments memory to optimize space.

üî¥ **More expensive than Young GC but necessary for long-lived objects**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Incremental & Concurrent Garbage Collection**
To **reduce GC pauses**, V8 uses:
‚úÖ **Incremental GC** ‚Äì Breaks large GC operations into smaller steps.  
‚úÖ **Concurrent GC** ‚Äì Runs parts of GC **in parallel** with JavaScript execution.  

---

### **Example: How Garbage Collection Works in Code**
```javascript
function testGC() {
  let shortLived = {}; // Stored in Young Generation (New Space)
  let longLived = [];  // Stored in Old Generation after surviving multiple cycles

  for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {
    shortLived = { data: i }; // Old references get garbage collected quickly
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    longLived.push({ data: i }); // Stays in memory longer
  }
}

testGC();
```
üîπ **Objects inside the loop are collected quickly (Young Generation).**  
üîπ **The longLived array persists (Old Generation).**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ How to Optimize Memory Usage in Node.js**
‚úÖ **Avoid Global Variables** ‚Äì Global objects stay in memory and prevent GC.  
‚úÖ **Use `null` or `delete` for Unused References** ‚Äì Helps free memory.  
‚úÖ **Use Streams Instead of Buffers** ‚Äì Avoid loading large data into memory.  
‚úÖ **Monitor Heap Usage** ‚Äì Use `--inspect` or `process.memoryUsage()`.

### **Final Thoughts**  
V8 **automatically handles garbage collection** but understanding its mechanism helps optimize performance and memory usage.
