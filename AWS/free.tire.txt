Absolutely, you **can create a free AWS account** and explore services like EC2, S3 (bucket), and Lambda under the **AWS Free Tier**.

Here’s a step-by-step guide for you as a working professional:

---

### ✅ 1. **Go to the AWS Free Tier Page**  
Visit: [https://aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free)

Click **"Create a Free Account"**.

---

### ✅ 2. **Sign Up with Your Email**
- Use your personal or professional email address.
- Choose a strong password and a unique AWS account name.

---

### ✅ 3. **Enter Contact Information**
- Choose **"Personal"** account type (even though you're a developer, this avoids linking with company billing).
- Fill in your name, phone number, and address.

---

### ✅ 4. **Add a Payment Method**
- AWS **requires a debit/credit card** for verification.
- Don’t worry — **they won’t charge** you if you stay within Free Tier limits.
- You may see a **₹2 (or $1)** hold for verification, which is refunded.

---

### ✅ 5. **Verify Your Identity**
- Enter your **mobile number**.
- AWS will send an OTP (One-Time Password) via SMS or call.

---

### ✅ 6. **Choose a Support Plan**
- Select the **Basic Support Plan (Free)**.

---

### ✅ 7. **Start Using AWS**
- Once your account is ready (usually within 5-10 mins), log into the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
- Start exploring EC2, S3, and Lambda — many features are covered under the **12-month Free Tier**.

---

### ✅ **What’s Included in the AWS Free Tier?**

### ⚠️ Tips to Avoid Charges:

- Always **stop or terminate unused EC2 instances**.
- Use **budgets and billing alerts** from the AWS Billing dashboard.
- Monitor your **Free Tier usage**:

If you want, I can also help you set up a small EC2 instance, upload to S3, or write a simple Lambda function after your account is created. Just say the word!















The URL https://portal.aws.amazon.com is the AWS Account Management Portal, specifically for:

🔐 Billing & Account Settings
When you go to this portal, you can:

View and manage your AWS billing and invoices

Update your account details (email, payment methods, etc.)

Close or reactivate an account

Set budgets and alerts

Access cost explorer to track usage

Check Free Tier usage








🔐 Root User (Selected by Default)
This is the main account owner who has full access to billing, service management, and security.
It's the email address you used to register with AWS (even if partially).
This is you, if you were trying to create the account.
✅ To proceed:
Enter the email you tried to use earlier when signing up.
Click Next
If it prompts for a password and you don’t know it, click “Forgot password?” on the next screen to reset it.



👥 IAM User (2nd Option - not selected)
For employees/teammates created inside an AWS account.
You can ignore this for now — it’s not what you need as an individual developer creating an account.










You're on the AWS Console Home screen — great start! 🔥 Here's how you can **check your billing, free tier usage, and previously used services**:

---

## ✅ 1. **Check Free Tier Usage**
### Steps:
1. In the **top search bar**, type: `Free Tier`
2. Click on **“Free Tier”** (should be the first result)
3. You'll see:
   - **Services used**
   - **How much of the free tier you've consumed**
   - Remaining limits for each service

---

## 💰 2. **Check Billing Details**
### Steps:
1. In the **top search bar**, type: `Billing`
2. Click on **“Billing Dashboard”**
3. Explore:
   - **Cost Explorer** (for graphs)
   - **Bills** (monthly breakdown)
   - **Free tier usage alerts**
   - **Payment history**

---

## 📦 3. **Check Previously Used Services**
### Steps:
1. Click on **"All services"** (left sidebar)
2. Scroll down or search for any AWS service (like EC2, S3, Lambda)
3. Go into each service and check for:
   - **Running or stopped instances**
   - **Logs/history** if any were used

OR

1. On the Console Home screen, under “Recently visited” — you’d normally see services you’ve accessed.
2. If blank (like in your screenshot), maybe the account is new or it’s a UI load issue (which happens sometimes).

---

### ⚠️ NOTE:
If you see **“Unable to load”** like in your image:
- Wait a bit and refresh the page
- Try switching **AWS regions** (top-right dropdown: Europe (Stockholm) → Change to N. Virginia or Mumbai etc.)
- It may also be a temporary **network or AWS-side issue**
