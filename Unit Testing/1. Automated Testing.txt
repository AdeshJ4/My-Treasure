What is Automated Testing?

-> The practice of writing code to test our code and then run those tests in an automated fashion.
-> With Automated Testing our source code consists application code which we also called production code and test code.

suppose we have a function that we want to test
so with manual testing : 
you have to launch the app, perhaps you have to login may be you have to do clicks to navigate the page where 
this function is used. then you have to fill the form and submit it and see the result of this function on The
screen. then you have to repeat the all these steps for different inputs.   


so this is going to take time.


now what this makes worse that its not only function that you have to test. In real application you have 10 or 
100 function to test.

thats why we use automated Testing.




With Automated Testing you write code and directly calls this function with different inputs 

You can rerun these tests every time you changed the code, every time you commit code to repository and before 
deploying the application.


you can write 1000 of automate tests for various parts of your application and run them all in few seconds.
