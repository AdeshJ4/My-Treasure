**Tooling Overview:**

- **Test Framework**:  
  To write tests, we need a **Test Framework**.  
  A Test Framework provides:
  
  1. **Utility Functions**: A set of built-in functions to help with writing and organizing tests.
  2. **Test Runner**: A program that runs tests from the command line, executes them, and generates a report showing how many tests passed or failed.

- **Popular Test Frameworks**:
  
  1. **Jasmine**  
     - A comprehensive testing framework that includes everything you need to test your application.
  
  2. **Mocha**  
     - By design, Mocha does not include assertions or certain features found in other testing libraries.  
     - It is often used with plugins like **Chai** (for assertions) and **Sinon** (for mocking and spying).

  3. **Jest**  
     - Developed by Facebook, Jest is commonly used for testing React applications.  
     - Jest is essentially a wrapper around Jasmine, providing additional features like snapshot testing.
