What kind of test you should write in your application.
-> well answer is all of them.

This is what we called test pyramid.




                   /\
                  /  \
                 /    \
                /      \
               /   E2E  \
              /----------\
             /            \
            /              \
           /  Integration   \
          /------------------\
         /                    \
        /                      \
       /         Unit           \
      ----------------------------








-> This pyramid argue the most of your tests should be in category of unit test, because they are easy to write and they execute quickly
-> Since unit test don't give much more connfidence about your applcaition health you should write bunch of integration test that test integration of your application 
code with its external dependencies.
-> At the end you have to write very few end to end for key functions of the application. test the happy path and leave the edge cases to unit test 
-> The actual ratio between unit, integration and end to end tests are depends on your project.
-> Unit test are great for quickly test the logic like conditional statemsts and loops, if you have methods with complex logic and calculations you should tet them with 
your unit tests. 

-> if you have function which simply reads data from write to DB in that case you need integration test than unit test.
