-> async-await are nothing but syntactically sugar over the promise.
-> "async and await make promises easier to write"
-> async makes a function return a Promise
-> await makes a function wait for a Promise

-> we write 'async' keyword before a function which is going to return promise.
-> The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.
-> The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues:

const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
    const res = await data.json();
    console.log(res);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err.message);
  }
};
