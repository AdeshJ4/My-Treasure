Great question! Let's clear this up:

---

## 🧠 Is JavaScript an OOP Language?

✅ **Yes**, JavaScript **supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — **but it's not a class-based language like Java or 
C++ by default**.

Instead, JavaScript is:

- **Prototype-based**
- **Object-oriented**
- **Dynamic and loosely typed**

With ES6 (`class` keyword), it **feels more like classical OOP**, but under the hood it still uses prototypes.

---

## 🔷 Core OOP Concepts Supported in JavaScript:

Here are the 4 pillars of OOP and how JavaScript supports them:

---

### 1. **Encapsulation** ✅

> Wrapping data (properties) and methods that operate on data into a single unit (object/class).

```javascript
class Person {

    name;
    age;
    count = 4;

    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log(`Name ${this.name} Age: ${this.age} count: ${this.count}`);
    }
}

let obj1 = new Person('Adesh', 22);
let obj2 = new Person('Manoj', 27);

obj1.name = 'Ram';
console.log(obj1.name);
```

You can also use closures or `#privateFields` for more strict encapsulation.


using closure: 
```
const createCounter = () => {
  let count = 0; // private variable

  return class Counter {
    increment() {
      count++;
    }

    decrement() {
      count--;
    }

    getCount() {
      return count;
    }

    setCount(value) {
      if (typeof value === 'number' && value >= 0) {
        count = value;
      } else {
        throw new Error('Invalid value for count');
      }
    }


  };
};

const Counter = createCounter();
const counter = new Counter();

counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
counter.setCount(10);
console.log(counter.count); // undefined (no direct access!)

```


---

### 2. **Abstraction** ✅

> Hiding complex details and showing only essential features.

You can abstract logic using functions, classes, or modules.

```javascript
class Car {
  startEngine() {
    this.#checkBattery();
    console.log("Engine started");
  }

  #checkBattery() { // private method (ES2020+)
    console.log("Battery checked");
  }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.startEngine();
// myCar.#checkBattery(); ❌ Error: private method
```

---

### 3. **Inheritance** ✅

> One class (or object) can inherit properties and methods from another.

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}
```

JavaScript supports **single inheritance**, **multilevel inheritance**, and mixins for **multiple inheritance-like behavior**.

---

### 4. **Polymorphism** ✅

Polymorphism means "many forms".

In object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method name in their own way.
> Same method name behaves differently based on the object calling it.

✅ In JavaScript:
JavaScript supports polymorphism through:

Method Overriding (most common)

Duck Typing (because JS is dynamically typed)

(To a limited extent) Function Overloading (can be simulated)



🔷 What is Method Overloading?
In many programming languages (like Java, C++, C#), method overloading means:

Creating multiple methods with the same name but different number or type of parameters.



1. Method Overriding (Class-based Polymorphism)
When a child class provides a different implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.

javascript
Copy
Edit
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Cat meows");
  }
}

const animals = [new Dog(), new Cat()];
animals.forEach(animal => animal.speak());
// Output:
// Dog barks
// Cat meows

## 🔧 Bonus: Additional Features Supporting OOP

| Feature                     | Supported?     | Description                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | -----------------------------------------------  |
| Classes                     | ✅ (ES6+)       | Syntactic sugar over prototypes                 |
| Constructors                | ✅              | Via `constructor()` method                      |
| Access Modifiers            | ⚠️ Limited     | `#privateFields` and conventions (`_protected`)  |
| Static Methods              | ✅              | `static` keyword                                |
| Getters/Setters             | ✅              | `get` and `set` keywords                        |
| Interfaces/Abstract Classes | ❌ (Not native) | Can be mimicked using duck typing or TypeScript |

---

## 📌 Final Verdict:

JavaScript is an **object-oriented, prototype-based** language that:

✅ Supports **all 4 pillars of OOP**  
✅ Offers **class-like syntax** (ES6)  
✅ Is **flexible** and great for both OOP and functional styles
