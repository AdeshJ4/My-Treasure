-> Both join() anf toString() are used to convert array into string with key difference that join accepts separator where toString()
does not.


1. join()
=========

-> The join() method returns an array as a string.
-> The join() method does not change the original array
-> Any separator can be specified. The default is comma (,).

const arr = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
let res1 = arr.join();  // Apple,Banana,Cherry
let res2 = arr.join(' and '); // Apple and Banana and Cherry


toString():
===========

-> The toString() method return as a string with array values separated by commas.
-> The toString() method does not change the original array.

const arr = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
let str = arr.toString();  // Apple,Banana,Cherry
