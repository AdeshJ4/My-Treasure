-> In javascript we don't have a class we only have objects.
-> Thats when prototypical inheritance comes in picture.
-> In javascript we have two types of inheritance.
1. classical Inheritance
2. Prototypical Inheritance







-> we know that in js we only have objects and not a class.
-> so how we are going to implememt inheritance using objects ?


-> here we have a circle object and can define another object lets called it shape and all add common behavior
or all common methods in the shape object.
-> and somehow we are going to link circle object to shape object.

circle -------> shape

-> Now we refer shape object as a prototype of the circle.
-> Prototype is essentially parent of another objects.
-> whenver you heard the word prototype just think parent.
-> Every object in javascript has a prototype or parent and it inherit all the members define in its prototype
