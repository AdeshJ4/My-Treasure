Q.2 typeof javascript function is "function" than why it said that "Functions are always objects" ?
==================================================================================================


-> In JavaScript, the `typeof` operator returns the type of a variable or expression. 
-> When you use `typeof` with a function, it returns `'function'`, indicating that the value is a function.
-> in JavaScript, functions are a special kind of object. 
-> While they are functions, they also have properties and methods like objects. 
-> Specifically, functions in JavaScript are instances of the `Function` object.








Guess the output : 
==================

Note: When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

let x = 16 + "Volvo"; // "16Volvo"
let y = "Volvo" + 16; // "Volvo16"
let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";//"20Volvo" -> JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right.
let x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4; // "Volvo164" -> since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings.
