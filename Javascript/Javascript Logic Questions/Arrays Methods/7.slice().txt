-> The slice() method returns selected elements in an array, as a new array.
-> The slice() method selects from a given start, up to a (not inclusive) given end.
-> The slice() method does not change the original array

ex.
const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
arr.slice(0); // [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ]
arr.slice(2, 4); // [ 30, 40 ]
arr.slice(-4, -2); // [ 20, 30 ]
arr.slice(-4); // [ 20, 30, 40, 50 ]
