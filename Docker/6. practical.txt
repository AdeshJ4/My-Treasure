create a folder named "hello-docker", inside this create a file named "app.js".

app.js: 
console.log("Hello Docker");


so this is our application.



// lets  think like this is a application/program and we want dockerize this application.
// we want to run, build and ship this with docker.
// without docker if you want to ship this application or program in another machine, we need 
// to install node and then we can got to terminal and type "node app.js" to get output.
/*
following are only 4 instructions but as our application grow we need multiple instructions
which are complicated.

instructions: 
1. Start with an OS
2. Install Node
3. copy app files
4. Run node app.js
*/

/*
we can run these above instruction in docker file, and let docker package our application.
