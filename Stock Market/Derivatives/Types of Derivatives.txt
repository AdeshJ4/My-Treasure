🔹 What are Derivatives?

A derivative is a "financial contract" whose value depends (or is “derived”) from the price of something else (called the underlying asset).
That "something else" could be:
A stock (e.g., Reliance share)
An index (e.g., Nifty, Sensex)
A commodity (e.g., gold, oil)
A currency (e.g., USD/INR)
👉 So, derivatives don’t have their own independent value; they get value from the underlying asset.


🔹 Example in Daily Life:
Think of mangoes 🍋.
Suppose mangoes are ₹100 per kg today.
You and I make a deal: Next month, I’ll buy 10 kg from you at ₹100 per kg, no matter what the price is then.
🟢 If next month mangoes become ₹150 per kg → I get profit.
🔴 If price falls to ₹80 → I face loss.
⚡ That "agreement" itself is a "derivative contract" (its value depends on mango price).



🔹 Why Derivatives Exist?

Hedging (protection) → Reduce risk (e.g., farmer locks in crop price before harvest).
Speculation → Traders bet on price movements to earn profit.
Arbitrage → Take advantage of price differences in different markets.
