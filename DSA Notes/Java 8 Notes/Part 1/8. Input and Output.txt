-> A stream required to accept input from the keyboard.
-> A stream represent flow of data from one place to another place.
-> A stream is always required if we want to move data from one place to another.

-> Basically there are two types of streams are there; 
1. Input stream
2. output stream

-> Input stream receives or read data from some other places.
-> Output stream sends or write data.

-> All Streams are represent by classes in java.io (i/p & o/p) 


We use InputStreamReader  that can read data from the keyboard
We use BufferedReader as it has got methods to read data properly.

Now connect InputStreamReader to BufferReader: 
InputStreamReader obj = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(obj); 

System.in: This represent InputStream object which by default represent standard input device, i.e keyboard.

Now we can read data comming from the keyboard using readLine() and read().




Scanner class: 
--------------
The Scanner class in Java is part of the java.util package 
The Scanner class in Java is commonly used to take input from the user. It provides convenient methods to read various types of input, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and more, from different sources like the console or files.

nextInt(): Scans the next token of the input as an int.
nextLong(): Scans the next token of the input as a long.
nextDouble(): Scans the next token of the input as a double.
nextFloat(): Scans the next token of the input as a float.
nextByte(): Scans the next token of the input as a byte.
nextShort(): Scans the next token of the input as a short.
nextBoolean(): Scans the next token of the input as a boolean.
next(): read word
nextLine(): read whole sentence
