1️⃣ What is GraphQL, and how does it differ from REST?

👉 GraphQL is a "query language for APIs" that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing "over-fetching" and "under-fetching" of data.

👉 GraphQL is used on both the client and backend

👉 Apollo Server (@apollo/server), Express-GraphQL, and Mercurius are different "GraphQL servers" implementations that provide ways to set up and run a GraphQL API.
Each of these libraries helps handle GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions, but they have different architectures and features. 


🟠 What is a GraphQL Server?
👉 when you say "GraphQL server", you are referring to a backend service that implements the GraphQL specification and processes GraphQL queries
👉 A GraphQL server is a part of your Node.js backend, not separate from it.
👉 If you are using @apollo/server, your GraphQL server runs inside your Node.js application and directly handles API requests.


🟠 GraphQL vs. GraphQL Server

GraphQL: Just a specification (like SQL is for databases).
GraphQL Server: A backend implementation that follows the GraphQL specification.

🟠 Examples of GraphQL Servers

👉 Apollo Server (@apollo/server)
👉 Express-GraphQL
👉 Mercurius (Fastify-based)
👉 Hasura (Auto-generates GraphQL APIs for databases)
👉 GraphQL Yoga (Lightweight GraphQL server for any JS framework)



🟠 Differences from REST:

👉 Flexible Data Fetching – Clients specify the exact fields they need, unlike REST, where fixed endpoints return predefined data.

👉 Single Endpoint – GraphQL typically uses a single "/graphql" endpoint, whereas REST has multiple endpoints for different resources.

👉 Efficient Data Fetching – Fetch multiple related resources in a single request, avoiding multiple API calls in REST.

👉 Strongly Typed Schema – GraphQL uses a "schema" to define the structure of API responses, while REST relies on standard JSON responses.

👉 Backend Agnostic – Works with any database or programming language, making it highly adaptable.

👉 No Over-fetching/Under-fetching – REST responses may include unnecessary data (Over-fetching) or require multiple requests(Under-fetching), while GraphQL delivers only 
what's requested.

Under-fetching happens when a REST API doesn't return enough data in a single request, forcing the client to make multiple API calls to gather all the required information.
✅ Example of Under-Fetching
GET /movies/123  
🔻 Response:
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "Inception",
  "directorId": 5
}
🚨 Problem: The API only returns directorId, so the client must make another request:
GET /directors/5
🔻 Response:
{
  "id": 5,
  "name": "Christopher Nolan"
}
📌 ❌ Multiple requests = slower performance

GraphQL Solution: The client specifies exactly what fields it needs, reducing data transfer and improving performance.

✅ Solution: Use GraphQL or Expand Data in REST
GraphQL: Fetch exactly what you need in one request.
```
{
  movie(id: 123) {
    title
    director {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

❓ where we use GraphQL?

✅ GraphQL is used on both the client and backend! 🚀

🔹 GraphQL on the Backend
📌 The backend defines the GraphQL schema and resolves queries.
It uses GraphQL servers like Apollo Server, Express-GraphQL, or Mercurius.
The GraphQL resolver functions fetch data from databases or APIs.

Example: Backend (Node.js with Apollo Server)
```
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Movie {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    director: String!
  }

  type Query {
    movie(id: ID!): Movie
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    movie: (_, { id }) => ({ id, title: "Inception", director: "Christopher Nolan" })
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen().then(({ url }) => console.log(`🚀 Server ready at ${url}`));
```


🔹 GraphQL on the Client
📌 The client sends GraphQL queries to the backend.
Uses GraphQL client libraries like Apollo Client, Relay, or urql.
Fetches only the required data.

Example: Client (React with Apollo Client)
```
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_MOVIE = gql`
  query GetMovie($id: ID!) {
    movie(id: $id) {
      title
      director
    }
  }
`;

function MovieDetails({ id }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_MOVIE, { variables: { id } });

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

  return <h1>{data.movie.title} - Directed by {data.movie.director}</h1>;
}
```


============================================================================================================================================================

❓ How do you define a GraphQL schema?

👉 In GraphQL, the schema defines the structure of your API, specifying types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

📌 Schema = Blueprint of your GraphQL API

type Movie {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  director: String!
  releaseYear: Int!
  genre: String!
  rating: Float
}




============================================================================================================================================================

❓ Explain the difference between "queries", "mutations", and "subscriptions" in GraphQL.

1️⃣ Queries – Fetch Data

Similar to GET requests in REST.
Used to retrieve data without modifying it.
Clients can request specific fields.

Example:
  Query: {
    movies: async () => await Movie.find(),
    movie: async (_, { id }) => await Movie.findById(id),
  },



2️⃣ Mutations – Modify Data

Similar to POST, PUT, DELETE in REST.
Used to create, update, or delete data.
Can return updated data after execution.

Example:
Mutation: {
    addMovie: async (_, { title, director, releaseYear }) => {
      const movie = new Movie({ title, director, releaseYear });
      return await movie.save();
    },
    updateMovie: async (_, { id, title, director, releaseYear }) => {
      return await Movie.findByIdAndUpdate(
        id,
        { title, director, releaseYear },
        { new: true }
      );
    },
    deleteMovie: async (_, { id }) => {
      await Movie.findByIdAndDelete(id);
      return "Movie deleted successfully";
    },
  },


3️⃣ Subscriptions – Real-time Updates

Uses "WebSockets" to push real-time updates to clients.
Clients stay connected and get notified when data changes.
we can integrate GraphQL Subscriptions using WebSockets (graphql-ws).

Example:
subscription {
  movieAdded {
    id
    title
  }
}


4️⃣ Resolver : 

A resolver is a function in GraphQL that handles fetching or modifying data for a specific field in a query, mutation, or subscription. 
It acts as the "bridge" between GraphQL and the database or API.
GraphQL Processes the queries using a resolver function.
Resolvers fetch data from a database, API, or other sources.
The returned data is structured according to the GraphQL schema
👉 The GraphQL resolver functions fetch data from databases or APIs.
✔️ ex: from databases:
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    movies: async () => await Movie.find(),
    movie: async (_, { id }) => await Movie.findById(id),
  },
  Mutation: {
    addMovie: async (_, { title, director, releaseYear }) => {
      const movie = new Movie({ title, director, releaseYear });
      return await movie.save();
    },
    updateMovie: async (_, { id, title, director, releaseYear }) => {
      return await Movie.findByIdAndUpdate(
        id,
        { title, director, releaseYear },
        { new: true }
      );
    },
    deleteMovie: async (_, { id }) => {
      await Movie.findByIdAndDelete(id);
      return "Movie deleted successfully";
    },
  },
};

✔️ ex: from api: 
    resolvers: {
      Todo: {
        user: async (todo) =>
          (await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${todo.userId}`))
            .data,
      },
      Query: {
        getTodos: async () =>
          (await axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")).data,
        getUsers: async () =>
          (await axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")).data,
        getUser: async (parent, { id }) =>
          (await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`)).data,
      },
    },
