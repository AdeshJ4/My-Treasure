-> Mongoose give us simple api to work with mongodb database.
-> Mongoose is build top og the mongodb database.
-> Mongoose is an ODM(Object data Modeling) library, which means it allows you to define schemas (blueprints for document) and 
models (constructors for creating documents based on those schemas).

Schema : 

-> In mongoose we have this concept called schema.
-> this is specific to mongoose its not a part of a mongodb.
-> we use the schema in mongoose to define shape of a  documents in mongodb.
-> we use it to define what are the properties we have in this document.
-> this schema define shape of course document in mongodb database.
-> here we are creating instance of Schema class.

const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    author: String,
    tags: [String],
    date: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now()
    },
    isPublished: Boolean
})
const Course = mongoose.model('Course',courseSchema);
const course = new Course({
    name: 'Node Js',
    author: 'Mosh',
    tags: ['Node', 'backend'],
    isPublished: true
})


Schema Types : 
--------------
1. String
2. Number
3. Date
4. Buffer (which is used to store binary data)
5. Boolean
6. ObjectID (used for signing unique identifier)
7. Array




Model : 

-> models is constructors for creating documents based on those schemas.
-> we need to compile schema into a model. 
-> mongoose have a method called model() which takes two arguments. 
first argument is singular name of the collection that this model is for.
second argument is schema which define shape of document of this collection.
-> Once we have schema we need to compile that into a model which give us the class(Course), next we can create an object(course) 
based on that class and this object map to a document in a mongodb database.

ex.

const Course = mongoose.model('Course',courseSchema);
const course = new Course({
    name: 'Node Js',
    author: 'Mosh',
    tags: ['Node', 'backend'],
    isPublished: true
})




Mongoose Methods: 

1. Create (Insert) -    create()
2. Read (Find) -        find(), findOne(), findById()
3. Update -             updateOne(), updateMany(), findOneAndUpdate(), findByIdAndUpdate()
4. Delete -             deleteOne(), deleteMany(), findOneAndDelete(), findByIdAndDelete()
