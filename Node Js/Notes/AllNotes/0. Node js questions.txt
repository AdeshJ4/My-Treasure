Q] why we use express.json() 
============================
In Express.js, the `express.json()` middleware is used to parse incoming JSON data from HTTP requests. It's commonly used when you expect the client to send JSON data in the request body, such as in a POST or PUT request. Here's why you use `express.json()`:

1. **Request Body Parsing:** When a client sends JSON data in the request body, you need to parse and access that data in your Express route handlers. The `express.json()` middleware parses the JSON data and makes it available as a JavaScript object in the `req.body` property.

2. **Ease of Use:** It simplifies the process of working with JSON data, so you don't have to manually parse the incoming data using `JSON.parse()`. You can directly access the parsed JSON data using `req.body`.

3. **Error Handling:** `express.json()` also performs error handling. If the incoming data is not valid JSON, it will catch the parsing error and send an HTTP 400 Bad Request response, which helps prevent your application from crashing due to malformed JSON.

Here's an example of how to use `express.json()` in an Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse incoming JSON data
app.use(express.json());

// Route handler that expects JSON data in the request body
app.post('/example', (req, res) => {
  const jsonData = req.body;
  // You can now work with the parsed JSON data in `jsonData`
  res.json({ message: 'Received JSON data', data: jsonData });
});

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example, the `express.json()` middleware is used to parse incoming JSON data, making it accessible in the route handler. This allows you to work with the JSON data sent by clients easily.

Q] explain middleware and what is the use of app.use() in node js.?
===================================================================

In Node.js, `app.use()` is a method commonly used in web application frameworks like Express.js. It is used to define middleware functions that can process and modify incoming requests and outgoing responses before they reach their final destinations (e.g., route handlers).

Here's a brief explanation of its use:

- `app.use()` is used to add middleware functions to your application.
- Middleware functions can perform tasks like authentication, logging, parsing request data, and more.
- Middleware functions are executed in the order they are added to the application.
- They can manipulate request and response objects and pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

In summary, `app.use()` is a way to apply common tasks and processing to incoming requests and responses across your application, making it a powerful tool for handling various aspects of web application logic.

Q. what is express js and why we use it ?

-> 
Express is used in Node.js for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies the process of handling routes, requests, and responses, making it easier and faster to create web services and applications.
