Express: req.params, req.query and req.body:
============================================



1. req.body
Generally used in POST/PUT requests.
Use it when you want to send sensitive data(eg. form data) or super long JSON data to the server.

using axios: 
axios.post('/giraffe', {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2'
  })

how  to get data from request body
app.get('/giraffe', (req, res) => {
   console.log(req.body.key1) //value1
   console.log(req.body.key2) //value2
  })




2. req.params
These are properties attached to the url i.e named route parameters. You prefix the parameter name with a colon(:) when writing your routes.

For instance,
  app.get('/giraffe/:number', (req, res) => {
   console.log(req.params.number)
  })
To send the parameter from the client, just replace its name with the value
  GET  http://localhost:3000/giraffe/1




3. req.query
req.query is mostly used for searching, sorting, filtering, pagination, etc.
Say for instance you want to query an API but only want to get data from page 10, this is what you'd generally use.
It written as key=value
  GET  http://localhost:3000/animals?page=10
To access this in your express server is pretty simple too;
  app.get('/animals', ()=>{
   console.log(req.query.page) // 10
  })
