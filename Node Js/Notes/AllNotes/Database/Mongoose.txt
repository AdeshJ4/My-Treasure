-> Mongoose is build top of the mongodb database.
-> Mongoose give us simple api to work with mongodb database.
-> Mongoose wraps the MongoDB driver with additional functionality and features.
-> Mongoose is an ODM(Object data Modeling) library, which means it allows you to define schemas (blueprints for document) and 
models (constructors for creating documents based on those schemas).
-> it provides more user-friendly interface for interacting with MongoDB compared to the native MongoDB driver
-> While Mongoose uses the MongoDB driver under the hood, it introduces its own set of methods and features, making it easier to 
work with MongoDB in a Node.js application.


Schema : 

-> In mongoose we have this concept called schema.
-> schema is like blueprints for document.
-> this is specific to mongoose its not a part of a mongodb.
-> we use the schema in mongoose to define shape of a  documents like which properties we want inside a documents, that properties you 
define inside a schema.
-> If you try to insert a empty document inside a database. mongodb will insert that document without any error and warning.
so in summary mongodb don't care about what are you inserting inside a database.
to prevent this behavior we use schema.
-> this schema define shape of course document in mongodb database.
-> here we are creating instance of Schema class.

const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    author: String,
    tags: [String],
    date: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now()
    },
    isPublished: Boolean
})
const Course = mongoose.model('Course',courseSchema);
const course = new Course({
    name: 'Node Js',
    author: 'Mosh',
    tags: ['Node', 'backend'],
    isPublished: true
})


Schema Types : 
--------------
1. String
2. Number
3. Date
4. Buffer (which is used to store binary data)
5. Boolean
6. ObjectID (used for signing unique identifier)
7. Array




Model : 

-> models is constructors for creating documents based on those schemas.
-> we need to compile schema into a model. 
-> mongoose have a method called model() which takes two arguments. 
first argument is singular name of the collection that this model is for.
second argument is schema which define shape of document of this collection.
-> Once we have schema we need to compile that into a model which give us the class(Course), next we can create an object(course) 
based on that class and this object map to a document in a mongodb database.

ex.

const Course = mongoose.model('Course',courseSchema);
const course = new Course({
    name: 'Node Js',
    author: 'Mosh',
    tags: ['Node', 'backend'],
    isPublished: true
})




Mongoose Methods: 

1. Create (Insert) -    create(), save()
2. Read (Find) -        find(), findOne(), findById()
3. Update -             updateOne(), updateMany(), findOneAndUpdate(), findByIdAndUpdate()
4. Delete -             deleteOne(), deleteMany(), findOneAndDelete(), findByIdAndDelete()


MongoDB Methods:

1. Create : insertOne() insertMany()
2. Read : find(), findOne(), findOneAndDelete(), findOneAndReplace(), findOneAndUpdate()
3. Update : updateOne(), updateMany()
4. Delete: deleteOne(), deleteMany()
