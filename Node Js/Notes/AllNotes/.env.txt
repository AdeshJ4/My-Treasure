what is .env file in node js
----------------------------
-> A .env file (short for "environment file") is a plain text file used to store configuration settings, sensitive information, and environment variables, API Keys, 
database credentials for an application
-> These variables are typically used to configure the application's behavior based on the environment it is running in (e.g., development, testing, production).

A .env file contains key-value pairs, where each line represents a variable.
example:
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/mydb
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEBUG=true
PORT=3000
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here



step 1: Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project.
step 2: Add key-value pairs for your configuration settings
step 3: Use a library or tool to load the variables into your application. For example:
To use the values in the .env file in a Node.js application, we need to install the dotenv package, which is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables 
from a .env file into process.env.
$npm i dotenv
code: 
server.js
---------
require('dotenv').config()
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY
// Use the values in the application





Best Practices for Using .env Files: 

1. Do Not Commit to Version Control:
Add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to your repository. This avoids exposing sensitive information.

2. Use Different .env Files for Different Environments:
Create separate .env files for development, testing, and production (e.g., .env.development, .env.production).

3. Keep Sensitive Data Secure:
Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your code. Always use environment variables.

4. Validate Variables:
Ensure required variables are present and valid when the application starts.

5. Use Default Values:
Provide default values for non-sensitive variables to avoid errors if the .env file is missing.



process.env in Node.js: 

process is a global object in Node.js, just like window is a global object in the browser
process.env is an object in Node.js that stores environment variables, allowing you to access and manage configuration settings without hardcoding them in your code.

Key Points:
It is part of the global process object.
Used to store secrets, API keys, database URIs, and environment-specific settings.
Helps in separating configuration from the code for security and flexibility.




❓ Can you modify process.env at runtime?
✅ Answer:
Yes, but changes only affect the current execution and do not persist. Example:
process.env.MY_VAR = "newValue";
console.log(process.env.MY_VAR); // Output: newValue
However, this is not recommended for storing secrets dynamically.



❓ How can you check which OS your Node.js app is running on?
✅ Answer:
console.log(process.platform); // 'win32' (Windows), 'darwin' (Mac), 'linux'

❓ How do you get the current working directory in Node.js?
✅ Answer:
console.log(process.cwd()); // Example: /home/user/project


❓ What happens if process.env is not defined?
✅ Answer:
If process.env is undefined (e.g., missing .env file), accessing a variable like process.env.PORT will return undefined, potentially breaking your app.


❓ Can you use process.env in a React (frontend) app?
✅ Answer:
Not directly! In React (Vite or Create React App), you must prefix environment variables with VITE_ (Vite) or REACT_APP_ (CRA) because process.env is not available in the browser.
Example (Vite):
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
Access it in React:
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL);
