web server:
----------

-> The primary function of a web server is to deliver web pages on the request to clients
-> This means delivery of HTML documents and any additional content that may be included by a document, such as 
	images, style sheets and scripts.
-> A web server is a computer program or software that runs on a computer and serves web pages over the internet. 
-> Essentially, it's a program that receives requests from web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and responds 
	with the appropriate web pages, images, videos, or other content.
-> When you type a website address in your browser, your computer sends a request to the web server hosting that 
	website.
-> The web server then finds the requested content, such as HTML files, images, videos, etc., and sends it back to 
	your browser as a response.


localhost:
----------

-> In simple terms, localhost is a way to refer to your own computer as if it were a remote server, and it allows 
	you to run and test web applications locally.

-> Localhost is a term used to refer to the computer that you are currently using.
-> it is a network interface that allows a computer to communicate with itself.
-> When you access the localhost on your computer, you are accessing a web server that is installed on your machine.
-> This web server can be used to run and test web applications locally before deploying them to a live server.
-> For example, let's say you are developing a website on your computer. You can use the localhost address (typically 
"http://localhost" or "http://127.0.0.1") in your browser to view the website as if it were live on the internet. 
This allows you to test and debug the website without making it publicly available.



web Framework:
--------------

-> In simple terms, a web framework is a tool that helps developers build web applications more efficiently by 
	providing pre-built solutions for common tasks and ensuring that the application is secure, scalable, and 
	maintainable.
-> Web frameworks typically include a variety of features and tools that are commonly used in web development, such 
	as routing, database integration, templating engines, and authentication systems.
-> These tools make it easier for developers to build complex web applications by providing pre-built solutions for 
	common tasks.
-> Frameworks typically provide security features such as input validation, CSRF protection, and password hashing, 
	making it easier for developers to build secure applications.
