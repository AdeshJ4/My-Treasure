Middleware & Request Processing Pipeline:
-----------------------------------------

-> Middleware is basically a function that takes a 'request object' and either returns a response to the client or passes 
control to another middleware function using next()..
-> at runtime, when we receive a request on the server that request goes through a pipeline we call this pipeline "Request Processing 
Pipeline".
-> In this pipeline we have one or more middleware functions. Each middleware function either terminates the request response cycle 
by returning a response object or it will pass control to another function.
-> So every request that we get on the server will go through our middleware function.
-> So an express application is essentially nothing but a bunch of middleware functions
-> Middleware functions are invoked in the order they are defined and are capable of modifying the request and response objects, 
as well as passing control to the next middleware function in the stack.
-> Middleware allow programmer to add functionality to the request response cycle such as authentication, logging, error handling and many more.
-> if you use lots of middleware functions inside your request processing pipeline then it will slow down your application.
-> Middleware can be defined globally, for all routes, or can be defined for specific routes or groups of routes. 
-> So an express application is essentially nothing but a bunch of middleware functions
-> app.use() method is used for adding middleware function.



// Define a route handler for the root path ('/')
app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
	res.send("Hello");
});
In the above ex tha callback function passes to route handler is the example of 'middleware function'.
"(req, res)=>{
	res.send("Hello");
}"
-> So in express every route handler function we have is technically a middleware function. because it takes a req object and returns 
res object to client. so it termites req-res cycle.
	







Building Custom Middleware: 
----------------------------


-> Ex. 

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

function middleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Front Middleware");
  next();
}

function middleware1(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Middleware 1");
  next();
}

function middleware2(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Middleware 2");
  next();
}

function middleware3(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Last Middleware");
  next();
}

app.use(middleware);
app.get("/part1", [middleware1, middleware2], (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("2 middleware function : [middleware1, middleware2]");
  next();
});
app.get("/part2", middleware1, (req, res) => {
  res.send("1 middleware function: middleware1 -> we terminate req-res cycle");
});
app.use(middleware3);

const port = 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});



Built in Middleware functions: 
===============================

1. app.use(express.json());

-> In Express.js, the `express.json()` middleware is used to parse incoming JSON data from HTTP requests. 
-> The `express.json()` middleware parses the JSON data and makes it available as a JavaScript object in the `req.body` property. 
so you don't have to manually parse the incoming data using `JSON.parse()`. 
-> it also performs error handling. If the incoming data is not valid JSON, it will catch the parsing error and send an HTTP 400 Bad
Request response, which helps prevent your application from crashing due to malformed JSON.


2. app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

-> is used to parse incoming URL-encoded data from the request body.
-> It parses application/x-www-form-urlencoded data (typically from HTML forms) and makes it available in req.body.
-> If you do not use express.urlencoded(), req.body will be undefined for x-www-form-urlencoded data.
-> HTML forms and React forms are different in how they handle user input.
-> If you're submitting a React form to a Node.js + Express backend, you typically send JSON data, not x-www-form-urlencoded. so need to use this middleware but 
make sure to use express.json().



3. app.use(express.static('public'));

-> It is used to serve static files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) from the "public" directory.
-> The folder does not have to be named "public". You can name it anything, but you must use the same name in express.static().
for ex: app.use(express.static("assets"));

my-app/
│── server.js
│── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   ├── script.js
│   ├── images/
│       ├── logo.png

app.use(express.static("public"));   // static file are aserve from root "/"

URL                                     Serves File
--------------------------------------  ------------------------
http://localhost:3000/                  public/index.html
http://localhost:3000/styles.css        public/styles.css
http://localhost:3000/script.js         public/script.js
http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png   public/images/logo.png


🔹 What If You Want a Custom Path?
You can serve static files from a custom URL path like /static: 
app.use("/static", express.static("public"));

Now, files must be accessed like this:
http://localhost:3000/static/styles.css
http://localhost:3000/static/images/logo.png





Third-party Middleware: 
=======================

nodemon 
jsonwebtoken
dotenv
express
helmet
compression



1. helmet : Helps secure your app by setting various HTTP Headers.
5. compression: optimizing the performance and efficiency of web applications by reducing the size of data sent between the server 
and clients.improve the speed and reduce the bandwidth.
6.dotenv: is used to load environment variables from a file named .env into process.env




Third-party Middleware:
nodemon: Nodemon is not exactly middleware but a utility that monitors changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server during development. It's often used in development environments to enhance the development workflow.
jsonwebtoken: This library is used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are commonly used for authentication and information exchange between parties.
dotenv: dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. It's commonly used to manage configuration settings in Node.js applications.
It enhances security by mitigating common web vulnerabilities.





1️⃣. helmet npm package: 
----------------------

-> The helmet npm package is a security middleware for Express.js that helps protect your Node.js application by setting various 
HTTP headers.
-> These headers help prevent common security threats like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and Information Leaks.
-> When a client (like a browser) makes a request to a server, the server responds with HTTP headers—extra pieces of information 
included in the response. These headers help control how the browser should handle the response.

Example of HTTP Headers
When you visit a website, the response might include headers like:
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
----

These headers tell the browser what to do with the response.

How Helmet Helps
The helmet package automatically sets these security headers to protect your app from attacks.

For example:

X-Frame-Options: DENY → Prevents your website from being loaded inside an <iframe> (prevents clickjacking).
Strict-Transport-Security → Forces browsers to always use HTTPS instead of HTTP (protects from man-in-the-middle attacks).
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff → Prevents the browser from guessing file types (stops MIME-type sniffing attacks).
Content-Security-Policy → Controls what resources (scripts, styles, images) can load on your site (prevents XSS attacks).
Example: Setting Headers with Helmet
When you use helmet() in Express:

app.use(helmet());
It automatically adds these headers to every response, making your app more secure.

In Simple Terms
🔹 HTTP headers are extra instructions sent with responses.
🔹 Helmet sets security-related headers to protect your app.
🔹 Without these headers, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities like XSS, clickjacking, or MIME-type sniffing.
🔹 Helmet is like a security guard for your Express app! 🚀




2️⃣. compression npm package: 
---------------------------

-> The compression middleware is used to compress HTTP responses, reducing the size of data sent over the network and 
improving application performance. This makes your website load faster and use less bandwidth.

How It Works
When a browser requests a page, the server normally sends the response as is. If the response is large (like JSON data or an 
HTML page), it can take longer to load.
With compression, the response is compressed before being sent to the browser. 
The browser then decompresses it automatically, reducing load time.

The server checks if the client (browser) supports compression.
If supported, the server compresses the response using gzip or Brotli.
The browser automatically decompresses the response and displays it normally

Example Without Compression
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 500KB
Content-Type: text/html

Example With Compression
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 50KB
Content-Type: text/html

You can see that the Content-Encoding: gzip header is added, and the size is reduced.


-----------------------------------------------------------------


3️⃣ debug package: 

-> The debug npm package is a popular logging utility used in Node.js applications
-> It provides a more flexible and controlled way to log debug information compared to console.log.
-> it is primarily used for debugging during development so install it as a dev dependency.
---------------
ex: 
server.js: 
const dotenv = require("dotenv").config();
const debug = require("debug");

const serverDebug = debug('app:server');
const dbDebug = debug('app:db');

serverDebug(`server related stuff`);
dbDebug('db related stuff')

.env file : 
DEBUG=app:server,app:db


---------------

Why Use the debug Package?

1. Namespaced Logging:
The debug package allows you to create namespaced loggers. 
Each logger is associated with a namespace (e.g., app:server, app:database), making it easy to filter and control which logs are 
displayed.
ex:
const debug = require('debug')('app:server');
debug('Server started on port 3000');


2. Environment-Based Logging:
You can enable or disable debug logs based on the DEBUG environment variable. 
ex:
.env file: 
DEBUG=app:startUp,app:db  #with this you can see debugging messages in these two namespaces
DEBUG=app:*               # to see all messages
DEBUG=                    #if don't want to see anything then set empty. ex. DEBUG=
DEBUG=app:db              # messages related to database


3. Selective Logging:
You can enable logs for specific namespaces while disabling others. This is useful for debugging specific parts of your application.
ex:
.env file: 
DEBUG=app:startUp,app:db  #with this you can see debugging messages in these two namespaces


4. No Logs in Production by Default:
By default, debug logs are disabled unless the DEBUG environment variable is set in .env file. 
This ensures that debug logs don't clutter your production logs unless explicitly enabled.


5. Color-Coded Output:
The debug package color-codes logs based on their namespace, making it easier to distinguish between different parts of your 
application.


6. Lightweight:
The debug package is lightweight and has minimal overhead compared to more complex logging libraries.


Can We Use It in Production?
Yes, but with caution.
It is generally recommended for debugging during development.
In production, you may want to log errors/warnings to a logging service (e.g., Winston, Bunyan, Sentry) instead.
However, if needed, you can enable debug in production by setting DEBUG=your_namespace in the environment variables.

4️⃣ : Morgan npm package: 

Morgan is HTTP Request Logger for Node.js
morgan is an npm package used in Node.js and Express applications for logging HTTP requests in the terminal. 
It helps with debugging and monitoring by providing detailed logs of incoming requests
✅ Logs each request to your server (method, URL, status, response time, etc.)

📊 Morgan Logging Formats:

Format	    output Example
-------------------------
dev	        GET / 200 5ms - 12B (method, URL, status, response time, size)
combined	  127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2025:10:00:00 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 12
common	    127.0.0.1 - - [24/Feb/2025:10:00:00 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
short	      GET / 200 5ms
tiny	      GET / 200 - 5ms

ex: > app.use(morgan("combined"));


📁 Writing Logs to a File

Instead of logging in the terminal, you can store logs in a file.
---
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");
const accessLogStream = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, "access.log"), { flags: "a" });

app.use(morgan("combined", { stream: accessLogStream }));
---

Now, all logs will be saved in access.log.





🚀 Why Use Morgan?
If you're building an API or server-side app, logs are essential.
It helps troubleshoot slow requests, failed requests, and security issues.
You can monitor traffic and performance
