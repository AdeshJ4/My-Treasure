-> sir i have created a project having name "Vidly"  which is a 'movie rental application' which runs locally on a video store.
-> with the help of this application we can rent a movie from a movie rental video store.
-> This movie rental application only runs locally on a video store.
-> The peoples which are going to use this application are the employees of that video store.
-> Its like application which we see in a dmart like shops.
-> Basically peoples who want to rent a movie will come to this movie shop and with this application we can register the user and 
creates its renal which contain customer details and which movie he rented.

-> The technology i used in this application are : 
1. ExpressJS :     "express": "^4.18.2",
2. Mongoose :     "mongoose": "^8.0.1", 
3. jsonwebtoken    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0",
4. "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
5. "nodemon": "^3.0.1"

 


-> Basically in this project i have created 5 APIs. which are as follows: 

1. Customer APIs
2. Movie API
3. Genre API
4. Rental API
5. User API



1. Customer API : 

-> Inside a customer api i have different route handlers to handle different kinds of requests.
-> Request like:  
getting all the customers,
getting a single customer
create a customer
update a customer
delete a customer



2. Movie API: 

-> This API is used for adding movies information inside a database.
-> When new movie stock comes, or new movie come in store we use this movie API to store all information of movies in database like 
movie name, its quantity, its genre, its daily rental rate.


3. Genre API

-> Each movie have a genre like Action, Romance, thriller, sci-fi
-> we use this genre api for : 

adding a genre of a movie 
updating genre name
deleting a genre 




4. Rental API

-> rental api is used to  manage a rental.
-> like rental consists of customer details, movie details like this information
-> The route handlers are : 
1. get all rentals
2. get single rental
3. create rental 


5. User API: 

-> user api is most important api because in this api i implement logic of authentication and authorization
-> User api  have most important route handlers.

we have two route handlers in this api : 
1. route handler for register User
2. route handler for login user

authentication: 
-> In the authentication part we are checking the employees is valid employees or not 
-> it contain checking email id and password of the employee. 
-> if the user is valid then we are going to give access to the application.
-> so here for comparing passwords we use 'bcrypt' package.
-> if the employee is not register then we are going to register it using registerUser route handler.
-> in this route handler, we are going to store a password of a employee in a database.  we are not going to store original p/w
in the database instead we are going to hashed the password convert it into a encrypted text and that encrypted p/w is 

login user: 


authorization: 
-> we have role based authorization.
1. normal employee
2. admin
-> In the authorization part we are checking the employee have access to a particular api end point or not.
-> like some endpoint are very important like deleting a movie, deleting a customer, deleting a genre, deleting a rental as well as
deleting a user, so basically all the deleting operations are very important and only be accessible by admin.
