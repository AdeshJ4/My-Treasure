-> we used to this package to store configuation setting of our application in json files or environment variables and overridig 
those setting in each environment (dev/prod).

-> for ex in development environment we are going to use different database or mail server

-> there are many npm packages available for managing configuration the most popular is rc but we are going to use config.

-> we should not store the application secrets in this configuration file 
for ex you should not store the p/w of your database or mail server
because when you checking your source code to a repository that p/w or that secret is visible to anyone who has access to that repo.


-> always store your secrets inside .env file and add that file in .gitignore



.env
----

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV="development" 
CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://127.0.0.1/vidly
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=SECRETKEYISBEHAPPY


I have two DB_Connection_String, one for local database and one for online cluster 
for local DB_Connection_String: mongodb://127.0.0.1/vidly
for online cluster DB_Connection_String: mongodb+srv://admin:admin@adeshcluster.aw42eyd.mongodb.net/vidly?retryWrites=true&w=majority
so what changes i have to make in following files.

custom-environment-variables.json:
----------------------------------
ex. 
{
    "DB_Connection_String": "CONNECTION_STRING",
    "jwtPrivateKey": "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY",
    "NODE_ENV": "NODE_ENV"
}




default.json :
-------------
-> in this file we are just defining a template for all the settings in our application
ex.
{
    "name": "",
    "Db_Connection_String" : "",
    "jwtPrivateKey": "",
    "NODE_ENV":""
}



development.json:
------------------
{
    "name": "development-vidly"
}



production.json: 
-----------------

{
    "name": "production-vidly"
}




-> Make sure spelling is correct
-> in this file we specify the mapping between our application setting and .env variables.
