-> In our Vidly application only authenticate user / login users can perform operations that modify data.

-> so if the user is annoymous or not log in we can only read data from below endpoints: 

/api/genres
/api/movies
/api/customers
/api/rentals


-> if you want to modify the data then you have to log in.

-> for more security, only admin can delete data from certain api

-> two do this we have add two more endpoints to our application 


1. Register : 
-> first we have to register the user.
-> for that we are going to send POST request
POST /api/users
-> post meanse we are creating new user, in this case a new user


2. Login : 
-> login used for authentication.
-> here is a question which http method we should use to login a user.
because with login we are not creating a user, not a updataing a user.
-> so how we can implement it in RESTfult terms
-> sometimes the operation you are dealing with does not have that create, read, update, delete operations.
-> the way we model this in real world is by reffering this as a request or command.
-> so we are creating a new login requests or login commad.
-> in this case we are using "POST" because we are creating new resourse.
POST /api/logins
-> In your application may be you stored all logins to a database in upder login collection.
