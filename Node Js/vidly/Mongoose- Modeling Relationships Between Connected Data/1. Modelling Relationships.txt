-> How to work with related Objects
-> Basically we have two approches : 


1. Using reference (Normalization)

-> with this approach we have separate collection for storing our authors
-> then we have another collection ("course") 

let authorDocument = {
    name: "Mosh"
};

let courseDocument = {
    author: 'id'  // id of author document
}

-> in the above ex we have author inside course collection that we set to the id of our author documenti author collection.
-> so here we are using reference.

2. Using embedded documents (Denormalization)
