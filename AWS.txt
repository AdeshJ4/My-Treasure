⭐ Cloud Computing: 
-------------------

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (like storage, servers, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more) 
over the internet (“the cloud”) instead of your local computer or data center.


These services are provided by cloud providers like:
----------------------------------------------------
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Microsoft Azure
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)


🔴 What Happens If We Don’t Use Cloud Computing?
------------------------------------------------

If we don't use cloud computing then you have to manage all the services like hardware, software, and networks by yourself.
Without cloud computing, everything becomes slower, more expensive, and harder to manage — especially as your business or 
application grows.


🚫 1. High Upfront Costs
You must buy servers, networking equipment, and storage.
Also need to pay for power, cooling systems, and physical space (like a data center or server room).


🛠️ 2. Complex Maintenance
You’re responsible for installing, updating, and maintaining everything — hardware, operating systems, security patches, softwares, etc.
Need a team of skilled IT professionals to manage it all.


⚖️ 3. Hard to Scale
If your traffic increases suddenly, you may not have enough capacity.
Scaling up means buying and setting up new hardware, which takes time and money.
If traffic drops, you’re stuck with unused servers.


🔐 4. Risk of Data Loss
If your server crashes, gets stolen, or suffers a fire or flood — your data could be lost permanently unless you’ve set up backups.


🧯 6. Disaster Recovery is Tough
If something goes wrong (e.g., power failure, natural disaster), restoring everything takes a lot more time and effort without cloud backup systems.




🟢 Why Do We Use Cloud Computing?
---------------------------------

1. Cost-Effective
You only pay for what you use (like a utility bill).
No need to buy expensive hardware or maintain servers.


2. Scalability
Easily scale up or down your computing power depending on your needs (e.g., traffic spikes).


3. Accessibility
Access your apps and data from anywhere in the world using an internet connection.


4. Reliability
Cloud providers offer high uptime and automatic backups, reducing the risk of data loss.


5. Performance
Cloud data centers are fast, secure, and globally distributed, which improves the performance of applications.

6. Security
Cloud providers invest heavily in security features (firewalls, encryption, etc.).

7. Automatic Updates
Software and infrastructure updates happen automatically without downtime or manual work.


👉 Common Use Cases:
--------------------
Hosting websites or applications
Data backup and disaster recovery
Big data analytics
Machine learning and AI
Email services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)
Streaming services (e.g., Netflix, Spotify)

models
🔥 Most Common for Beginners / Startups:
EC2 – for hosting
S3 – for file storage
Lambda – for serverless backend
RDS or DynamoDB – for database
IAM – for permissions
CloudWatch – for monitoring






Serverless:

-> Serverless doesn’t mean there are no servers. It just means you don’t have to manage the servers.
Instead of setting up, managing, and scaling servers, you only write your code, and the cloud provider (like AWS) takes care of 
the rest — running it, scaling it, and even shutting it down when not needed.
You only pay for what you use.
-> You pay only for the time it runs (like milliseconds or seconds).
-> Serverless is not only related to AWS, it can be found in Google, Microsoft, and many other providers. its just a service.
🛠️ AWS Serverless Example: AWS Lambda
Let’s take the most popular serverless service from AWS: AWS Lambda



🔴 disadvnatages: 🔴
1. cold start
2. Connection Pool for mongodb


❄️ What is a Cold Start?
A cold start happens when AWS runs your Lambda function for the first time (or after it's been idle for a while).

AWS needs to:
Create a new container
Load your code
Initialize dependencies
This takes a little extra time — usually a few hundred milliseconds, but can be longer if your function has heavy dependencies.

🕐 When Cold Starts Happen:
First time you invoke a function
After it's idle (usually 10+ minutes) (🔥 Warm Start )
During scaling (many new users at once)



🧠 What’s a Connection Pool?

A connection pool is a group of database connections that are kept open to be reused instead of opening a new one every time.
In traditional servers (like EC2), you open a pool once and reuse it.
In serverless, the function starts fresh each time (especially during cold starts), which can lead to too many open MongoDB connections if not managed properly.









✅ How it works:
Let’s say you want to build a function that resizes images when someone uploads a photo.

Without Serverless:
You’d have to create a server.
Keep it running all the time.
Handle scaling, updates, security, etc.

With Serverless (like AWS Lambda):
You write a function (e.g., resizeImage.js).
Upload it to AWS Lambda.
Event-Driven -> Run code on events like API calls, file uploads, database updates, etc.
Set it to trigger automatically when someone uploads an image to S3 (Amazon's storage service).
AWS runs your function only when needed and then shuts it down.
You pay only for the time it runs (like milliseconds or seconds).


❓ what actually happens when 1000 users interact with an AWS Lambda function:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When 1000 users call a Lambda function at the same time:
AWS automatically creates multiple instances of your function — like temporary copies — to handle all the requests in parallel.
Each request runs in its own isolated environment (like its own mini container).
You don’t manage or see these copies — AWS handles it all behind the scenes.
Once the function finishes executing and there's no traffic, AWS shuts down those copies to save cost.


⭐ one of the best parts about AWS Lambda
-> 
Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or working professional — if you're using your personal AWS account, you get:

🎁 Lambda Free Tier Includes:

| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Free Resource         | Amount                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1 million invocations | per month                 |
| 400,000 GB-seconds    | of compute time per month |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |

This free tier is available for 12 months after you create your AWS account.
After 12 months, you still get 1M free invocations per month, as part of the always-free tier — yes, AWS is generous here!



💻 What does this mean for you?
If you're:
Testing
Learning
Running small projects or experiments
You can easily use Lambda for free, unless you go way beyond the free limits (which is rare for learning purposes).


🔄 Real Example:
You run a Lambda function 1,000 times/day = 30,000 times/month → well under 1 million.
You pay $0.





🌐 Other AWS Serverless Tools:

AWS Lambda – Runs your code.
Amazon API Gateway – For creating APIs that trigger Lambda functions.
Amazon S3 – Serverless file storage.
DynamoDB – Serverless NoSQL database.
EventBridge or SQS – For handling events/messages


In non-serverless architecture yo have to manage everything like OS, Softeware, RAM, Storege, monitoring, security, configure
deployment, scale up/down, billing per hour: 
All this headache.

In serverless you just write code, thts it. AWS will automatically decide what RAM, Storage and other things based on you code.
1000 peoples invole our lambda function so 1000 * over invokation rate = monthly bill.
if you don’t have customer then bill will be 0.

❓❓❓❓   if i have movify application where each endpoint like getUsers, getMovies, getGenres, should i create a lambdaa function for each route, ?

Awesome question — and very common when thinking about **serverless architecture** for real-world apps like your **Movify application**!

---

### ✅ **Short Answer:**

> **Yes**, in a typical serverless design, you'd **create a separate Lambda function for each route** (like `getUsers`, `getMovies`, `getGenres`), **BUT** there's another option too 👇

---

### 🔀 **You Have Two Options:**

#### **Option 1: One Lambda per Route (Recommended for Microservices / Simple APIs)**
- Create one Lambda function **per endpoint**:
  - `GET /users` → `getUsersLambda`
  - `GET /movies` → `getMoviesLambda`
  - `GET /genres` → `getGenresLambda`

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Each function is small, focused, and fast
- Easier to scale independently

**Cons:**
- More setup in AWS (each route needs to be mapped to a Lambda)
- More functions to manage

---

#### **Option 2: Single Lambda for All Routes (Monolith-style Handler)**
- Use **one Lambda** with an internal **router** (like Express or a switch statement).
- All routes handled in one function.

```js
export const handler = async (event) => {
  const { path, httpMethod } = event;

  if (path === '/users' && httpMethod === 'GET') {
    return getUsers();
  }
  if (path === '/movies' && httpMethod === 'GET') {
    return getMovies();
  }
  // more routes...
};
```

**Pros:**
- Easier to get started
- Simple deployment (just one Lambda)

**Cons:**
- Gets messy as app grows
- Harder to scale parts separately
- Bigger cold start time

---

### 🧠 **Best Practice:**
For a project like Movify:
- If it's a **small/medium project**, you can start with **one Lambda with routing** (Option 2).
- As it grows, **split into separate Lambdas** for performance and better scaling (Option 1).

---

### Bonus Tip: Use **API Gateway**
- Use **AWS API Gateway** to route:
  - `GET /users` → Lambda A
  - `GET /movies` → Lambda B
  - `GET /genres` → Lambda C

⚡ What is EC2?

👉 EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is like renting a virtual computer (server) from Amazon.
👉 You can use it to run websites, apps, databases, or anything else — just like a real computer. 
But instead of sitting in your room, it's in Amazon's data center.

EC2 code always run wheter there is traffice or not.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature           | Meaning                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Elastic**       | You can easily scale up/down (more or less power) anytime.                  |
| **Customizable**  | Choose OS, memory, CPU, storage, and more.                                  |
| **Remote Access** | You can connect to your EC2 machine from anywhere (like using TeamViewer).  |
| **Secure**        | You control who can access your server using key pairs and security groups. |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

🚀 If Traffic Increases in EC2: What Happens?
✅ If You Don't Change Anything (No Auto Scaling):
Your EC2 instance handles traffic up to its limit (CPU, RAM).
If it gets overloaded, your app might slow down or crash.
Cost stays the same (you’re still paying for that one EC2 instance, 24/7).

⚙️ If You Enable Auto Scaling:
AWS automatically adds more EC2 instances to handle extra traffic.
You are charged for each extra instance (per second or hour).
More traffic = more EC2s = more cost.

🧠 Think of it like this:

Imagine you need a computer to run a big project.
Instead of buying one, you rent a powerful one from AWS through EC2.
You can choose how powerful it is (RAM, CPU, storage).
You can use it for 1 hour, 1 day, or forever — you only pay for what you use.


🔧 What Can You Do With EC2?

Host a website or backend server
Run a database (like MySQL or MongoDB)
Deploy a React app, Node.js app, etc.
Test apps on different operating systems
Build your own gaming or streaming server
