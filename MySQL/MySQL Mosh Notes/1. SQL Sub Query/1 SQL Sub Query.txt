Note: It's preferred to use the "JOIN" clause instead of a "subquery" whenever possible. 
----- It's because the execution speed of JOIN is faster and more optimized than a subquery.

Definition :
------------
A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is known as the main query, and the 
inner query is known as a subquery.

Important Rule:
---------------

-> A subquery can be placed in a number of SQL clauses like  SELECT clause, WHERE clause, FROM 
	clause, HAVING clause.
-> You can use Subquery with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE statements along with the operators 
	like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN, etc.
-> Subqueries are on the right side of the comparison operator.
-> Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses.
-> In the Subquery, "ORDER BY" command cannot be used. But "GROUP BY" command can be used to 
	perform the same function as ORDER BY command.
-> A subquery can have "only one column" in the SELECT clause, unless multiple columns are in the 
	main query for the subquery to compare its selected columns.
-> Subqueries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators such as
	 the IN operator.
-> The BETWEEN operator cannot be used with a subquery. However, the BETWEEN operator can be used 
	within the subquery.


Subqueries with the SELECT Statement
------------------------------------

select *
from emp 
where id in (
	select id 
	from emp 
	where salary > 90000
);


Subqueries with the INSERT Statement
------------------------------------

INSERT INTO tb1  
   SELECT * FROM tb2   
   WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID   
   FROM tb2);  


Subqueries with the UPDATE Statement
------------------------------------
Note : Both table must be different
update tb2
set salary = salary * 0.25 
where id in (
	select id 
    from tb1
    where age >= 25
);

Subqueries with the DELETE Statement
------------------------------------
Note : Both table must be different
DELETE FROM tb2  
WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM tb1 
WHERE AGE >= 26 );
