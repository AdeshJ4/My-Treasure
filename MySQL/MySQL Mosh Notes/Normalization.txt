What is Normalization ?
-----------------------

-> Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
-> Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. 
-> It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion 
	Anomalies.
-> Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships
-> The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table



Types of Normal Forms:
----------------------


1. First Normal Form (1NF)
-> A relation will be 1NF if it contains an atomic value.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
-> In the 2NF, relational must be in 1NF.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
-> A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and not contain any transitive partial dependency

4. Fourth normal form (4NF)
-> A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued dependency

5. Fifth normal form (5NF)
-> A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and not contains any join dependency and joining should 
	be lossless.
