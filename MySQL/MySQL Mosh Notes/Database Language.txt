Database Language
-----------------
-> Database languages can be used to read, store and update the data in the database.



Types of Database Language
--------------------------
1] DDL ( Data Definition Language )
2] DCL ( Data Control Language )
3] DML ( Data Manipulation Language )
4] TCL ( Transaction Control Language )


1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
-----------------------------

-> DDL stands for "Data Definition Language". 
-> It is used to define "database structure" or "skeleton of the database".
-> It is used to create schema, tables, indexes, constraints, etc. in the database
-> DDL statements are used to store the information of metadata like the number of tables and 
	schemas, their names, indexes, columns in each table, constraints,etc

Here are some tasks that come under DDL:
				 -----
Create: It is used to create objects in the database.
Alter: It is used to alter the structure of the tables.
Drop: It is used to delete objects from the database.
Truncate: It is used to remove all records from a table.
Rename: It is used to rename an object.


2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
-----------------------------------

-> DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. 
-> It is used for "accessing" and "manipulating" data in a database. 
-> It handles user requests.

Here are some tasks that come under DML:
				 -----
Select: It is used to retrieve data from a database.
Insert: It is used to insert data into a table.
Update: It is used to update existing data within a table.
Delete: It is used to delete all records from a table.



3. Data Control Language
------------------------
-> DCL stands for Data Control Language. 
-> It is used to retrieve the stored or saved data
-> The DCL execution is transactional. It also has rollback parameters

Here are some tasks that come under DCL:
				 -----
Grant: It is used to give "user access privileges" to a database.
Revoke: It is used to take back permissions from the user.


4. Transaction Control Language
-------------------------------

-> TCL is used to run the changes made by the DML statement. 
-> TCL can be grouped into a logical transaction.

Here are some tasks that come under TCL:
				 -----
Commit: It is used to save the transaction on the database.
Rollback: It is used to restore the database to original since the last Commit.
