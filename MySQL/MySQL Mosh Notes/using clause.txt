On clause as well as Using clause does the same work but if column names are same, go for the 
USING clause. Otherwise, if columns names are not same, go for ON clause.

ex

SELECT s.SID, s.SNAME, a.CNAME, c.MAJOR
FROM STUDENT s JOIN COLLEGE c
ON s.SID = c.SID;

SELECT SID, s.SNAME, a.CNAME, a.MAJOR
FROM STUDENT s JOIN COLLEGE c
USING (SID);

USING clause:

The USING clause is used if several columns share the "same name" but you don’t want to join using 
all of these common columns. The columns listed in the USING clause can’t have any qualifiers in 
the statement, including the WHERE clause:


The ON clause

The ON clause is used to join tables where the column names don’t match in both tables. 
The join conditions are removed from the filter conditions in the WHERE clause:

ex: 
----
select department_name, city
from departments dept
JOIN locations loc
-- on dept.location_id = loc.id
USING (location_id); -- specify the same column name 
                     -- for both of the tables for the join
select department_name, city
from departments dept
join locations loc
on (dept.location_id = loc.id); -- specify different column name 
                                -- for the tables for the join.
