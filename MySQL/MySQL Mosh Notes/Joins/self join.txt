MySQL SELF JOIN
---------------

-> A SELF JOIN is a join that is used to join a table with itself
-> there is a need to combine data with other data in the same table itself. In that case, we 
	use Self Join.
-> We can perform Self Join using "table aliases". 
	The table aliases allow us "not to use the same table name twice" with a single statement. 
	If we use the same table name more than one time in a single query without table aliases, 
	it will throw an error.
-> The table aliases allow us to use the temporary name of the table that we are going to use 
	in the query
-> Suppose we have a table named "student" that is going to use twice in the single query. 
	To aliases the student table, we can write it as:
		Select * 
		FROM student AS S1   
		INNER JOIN student AS S2;  



use sql_hr;

select e.first_name, e.job_title, m.first_name as manager
from employees e
inner join employees m
	on e.reports_to = m.employee_id;
