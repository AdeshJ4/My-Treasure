SQL PRIMARY KEY
-------------------------------
-> The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
-> Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
-> A table can have only "ONE primary key", and in the table this primary key can consist of 
	single or multiple columns (fields).
-> Primary key is made of single or multiple columns.
-> A column or columns is called primary key (PK) that uniquely identifies each row in the table.
-> When multiple columns are used as a primary key, it is known as composite primary key.
-> In designing the composite primary key, you should use as few columns as possible. It is good 
	for storage and performance both, the more columns you use for primary key the more storage 
	space you require.
	In terms of performance, less data means the database can process faster


Points to remember for primary key:
---------------------------------------------------------
-> Primary key always has unique data(not repeating)
-> A primary key cannot have null value
-> There can be no duplicate value for a primary key
-> A table can contain only one primary key
-> A primary key length cannot be exceeded than 900 bytes




SQL primary key for one column:
------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE students  
(  
S_Id int NOT NULL,  
LastName varchar (255) NOT NULL,  
FirstName varchar (255),  
Address varchar (255),  
City varchar (255),  
PRIMARY KEY (S_Id)  
)  


SQL primary key for multiple columns:
------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE students  
(  
S_Id int NOT NULL,  
LastName varchar (255) NOT NULL,  
FirstName varchar (255),  
Address varchar (255),  
City varchar (255),  
CONSTRAINT pk_StudentID PRIMARY KEY (S_Id, LastName)  
)  




SQL primary key on ALTER TABLE
------------------------------

Primary key on one column:
--------------------------
ALTER TABLE students  
ADD PRIMARY KEY (S_Id)  


Primary key on multiple column:
-------------------------------
ALTER TABLE students  
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_StudentID PRIMARY KEY (S_Id,LastName)
