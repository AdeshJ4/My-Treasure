SQL DROP Database
-----------------
-> deletes the existing database "permanently" from the database system
-> This statement deletes all the views and tables if stored in the database, so be careful while 
   using this query in SQL.

Syntax:
-------
-> DROP DATABASE Database_Name;


Before deleting Database:
-------------------------
-> keep the backup of data of that database which you want to delete.
-> Another most important point is that you cannot delete that database from the system which is 
   currently in use by another database user. If you do so, then the drop statement shows the 
   following error on screen:
	Cannot drop database "name_of_the_database" because it is currently in use.
