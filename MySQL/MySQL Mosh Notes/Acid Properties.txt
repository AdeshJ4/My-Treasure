ACID Properties in DBMS


A = Atomicity
C = Consistency
I = Isolation
D = Durability


1) Atomicity: The term atomicity defines that the data remains atomic. 
				 It means if any operation is performed on the data, either it should be performed 
or executed completely or should not be executed at all. It further means that the operation 
should not break in between or execute partially.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Consistency: The word consistency means that the value should remain preserved always. 
					In DBMS, the integrity of the data should be maintained, which means if a change 
in the database is made, it should remain preserved always. In the case of transactions, the 
integrity of the data is very essential so that the database remains consistent before and after 
the transaction. The data should always be correct.
The Database must be consistent before and after the trannsaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Isolation: The term 'isolation' means separation. In DBMS, Isolation is the property of a 
				 database where no data should affect the other one and may occur concurrently.
It means if two operations are being performed on two different databases, they may not affect 
the value of one another.
Any changes that occur in any particular transaction will not be seen by other transactions until 
the change is not committed in the memory.

Example: account A is making T1 and T2 transactions to account B and C, but both are 
executing independently without affecting each other. It is known as Isolation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Durability: Durability ensures the permanency of something. In DBMS, the term durability 
					ensures that the data after the successful execution of the operation becomes 
permanent in the database. The durability of the data should be so perfect that even if the 
system fails or leads to a crash, the database still survives.
