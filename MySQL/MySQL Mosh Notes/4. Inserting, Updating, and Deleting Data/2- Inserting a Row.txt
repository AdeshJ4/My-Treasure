There are two ways of inserting data 

1. insert data in all columns.
-> INSERT INTO customers VALUES('Adesh', 'Jadhav', 21, 'Pune');
2. insert data in specified columns.
-> INSERT INTO customers (f_name, l_name, age, city) VALUES('Adesh', 'Jadhav', 21, 'Pune');




Corner case 1:

if you want to add values in all columns and your first column is customer_id(primary key + Auto increment key)
then you can write 'DEFAULT' in its place or you can write any random no but if you do this and bychance 
there present record with that no then it will give you error so its better to write 'DEFAULT' in 
primary key.

Ignore above case if you are adding data in specific columns
