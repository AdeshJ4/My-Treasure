How to copy data from one table to another

--> 

CREATE TABLE orders_archived AS 
SELECT * FROM orders


--> Explanation

Here "orders_archived" is copy table name and "orders" is original table
in "orders_archived" table we don't have primary key & Auto increment key


when we create a new table using this technique, mysqll will not assign any primary key or auto increment key
to new table, we have to assign it explicitly 



subquerry:

-> subquerry is a select statement part of another sql statement
-> we can also use subquerry inside insert statement, it is very powerful technique.
-> example 1: 
	here we have separate select statement that can be inserted inside insert querry: 
	-> select * from orders where order_date < '2019-01-01';
	Here is full querry with insert statement
	-> insert into orders_archived select * from orders where order_date < '2019-01-01';
-> example 2:
	CREATE TABLE orders_archived AS SELECT * FROM orders;
