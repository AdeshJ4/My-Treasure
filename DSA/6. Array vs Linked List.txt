we should able to differentiate In term of require memory and time complexity of various operations.

-> Arrays/static arrays have fixed size if we don't know head of time how many items we are going to store then either we have to use dynamic array.
-> Dynamic array grow by 50%-100% so we end up wasting space.


-> Linked list only take necessary memory.
-> Linked list take little bit extra space to store address of next node.

-> If we know head of time how many items we are going to store then we should use array.

-> Some operations are faster in linked list and slower in array or vice versa.
