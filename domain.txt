What is a Domain?

Imagine the internet is like a giant city, and every website is like a house in that city. Now, just like every house has an address (like "123 Street Name") so people can find it, every website has an address too. That address is called a **domain**.

Domains Are Like Addresses:
- Just like you need an address to visit a friend's house, you need a domain to visit a website.
- A domain tells your computer exactly where to go to find that website.

Examples of Domains:
- amazon.in: This is the address for Amazon's website in India.
- flipkart.com: This is the address for Flipkart’s website.

So, when you type **amazon.in** or **flipkart.com** in your browser, it's like telling your computer, "Hey, take me to this house (website)!" Your computer knows exactly where to go because the domain is the address.

Breaking Down a Domain:
Let’s take `amazon.in` as an example:
- amazon: This part is the name of the website (like the name of the house).
- .in: This part tells you it's an address in India (just like how some addresses end with "Street" or "Avenue"). 

Similarly, for `flipkart.com`:
- flipkart: The website’s name.
- .com: Tells us it's a common commercial website.

Why Do We Use Domains?
Domains make it easy for us to find and visit websites. Imagine if you had to remember a long string of numbers (like a phone number) instead of a simple name like `amazon.in`—it would be really hard! Domains make the internet friendly and easy to use.

So yes, **amazon.in** and **flipkart.com** are domains, just like addresses that lead you straight to their websites!
