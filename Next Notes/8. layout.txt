Layouts: 

-> layout.tsx is special file.
-> we use layout to create UI that shared between multiple pages.

we can create custom layout for ex>
if all our admin pages need a particular UI we can create a custom layout for our admin area.

Navigation panel is common for all pages so we define inside rootlayout.tsx
