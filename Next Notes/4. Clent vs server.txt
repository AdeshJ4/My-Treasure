In next js we can render components in two ways and generate HTML markup:

1. On client side (web browser)
2. On server side (Node js Runtime)


Rendering component on client side is similar to how we render component in react.
we refer this technique as CSR.




In Server side (SSR) component render on server side



Server component cannot: 
1. Listen to browser events (click events) 
2. Access browser APIs (localStorage)
3. Maintain State (useState)
4. Use Effect





Query string parameter are a way of passing data on the server.
Access query string parameter inside a page and pass it to component.
