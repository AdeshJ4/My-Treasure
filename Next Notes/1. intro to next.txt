Creating a new Next.js app in E:\z Placement\Mosh\Next.js\Projects\car_showcase.


PS E:\z Placement\Mosh\Next.js\Projects\car_showcase> npm run dev






-> A framework for building fast and search engine friendly applications.
-> build on top of react.
-> React is just a library for creating interactive UI interface
-> Next js is a framework.
framework = libs + tools + conventions

-< Next js includes its own React Router so we don't have to use separate library like react router.


in terms of tooling it comes with compiler for transforming and minify JS code and CLI for building and start up application and Node js Runtime for executing Node code.
1. Compiler (transforming and minify JS code )
2. CLI (building and start up application )
3. Node.js Runtime (executing Node code)



We can write both frontend and backend code within same Next js Project.


Static site generation:
-> We can pre render certain pages/components that have static data when we build or application. we render them just once and serve them whenever they needed.




Next App create Steps: 

-> npx create-next-app@latest ./  (will create app in current folder)
